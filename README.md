# VGAcontrol library for arduino / rp2040 / rp2350

This is an arduino library providing a display driver using the VGA protocol for the RP2040 and RP2350 microcontroller.
The goal of this lib is to provide an easy way to drive a relatively low-res vga screen from directly the arduino
framework, and not having to install the pico development environment.
